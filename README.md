# B.Y.O.C (Build Your Own Code)
A collection of code examples for the purpose of educating and learning how build your own code, and not rely on third 
party software. The ultimate goal of this project is to help engineers to feel empowered to make a decision to use
another's library, or build their own.

Many engineers use whatever gets the job done. This kind of mentality can lead to not knowing or not understanding how 
their code works. This is an issue because the reason to be an engineer is to build and understand. Using simple 
libraries for simple use case can be harmless; but whats the overall benefit when its code from an author you've most
likely have never met? 

You have to regularly check for version updates. What happens when an update has a breaking change? Do you downgrade
the library version and hope theres a fix being worked on? Do you report the bug? Do you contribute a pull request 
to the project's source? Does the author accept outside contribution? Who else contributed to this project? Are the 
other contributers trustworthy? Seems like a lot of record keeping, especially if the library is just a simple logger.

## Understanding the Code
Within this README, you'll find find links to other branchs. Inside those branches will contain code to accomplishing
various design patterns, or simplified code of popular libraries. These code examples will also have links to a blog
post, explaining the code more in-depth (if not, that means I'm currently working on it). Hopefully these examples break
down code, one would preceived to be complex, into something more consumable.
